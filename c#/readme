Cache Library aka "Cache-r in the Rye"

ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ


Installation and Building Notes:
	Written for .Net 4.5 on Windows 7
	Note - I removed all binary files from the solution, this includes the nuget dlls, so those will need to be downloaded/replaced.


Usage:
	var _cache = new Cache<KEY_TYPE, VALUE_TYPE>(new Options(NUMBER_OF_SETS, NWAY_POWER));

Optionally, provide a ByteArrayConverter or ReplacementPolicy:
	var _cache = new Cache<KEY_TYPE, VALUE_TYPE>(new Options(NUMBER_OF_SETS, NWAY_POWER))
	{
		ByteArrayConverter = new ...,
		ReplacementPolicy = new ...
	}
Custom implementations of these can be created using the included interfaces.


Validation and Example Usages:
	The solution includes an NUnit test project with 20+ tests for validation and example use cases.


Limitations:

- replacement policy based on read position will eventually run out of room for indexes
- currently no concept of stale blocks
- no way to "flush" the cache, although a simple version could be implemented easily enough
- default implementation of IByteArrayConverter is quirky (seemingly because BinaryFormatter includes metadata when serializing?)
